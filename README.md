CAH-Generator
=============

Original author: 

Uses imagemagick to create Cards Against Humanity images for printing on actualy cards through a print studio.

Originally I'd planned on generating the entire card on the fly. However, my lack of imagemagick acumen, combined with how CPU intensive the process is for the shitty host I have this hosted on made that infeasable. So I start with the cards as fully formed as I can, and simply add the text. The font file is ommited, because it's not a free font, and I don't have the rights to distribute it.

You can see it in action at:

For those interested in making their own card images from scratch, 'notes.rtf' has the closest I have to something you can use to recreate the steps I took. Every time I tried something new that I felt I might want to reference back to, I threw it in there. It's by no means complete, will probably frustrate you more than help you, and I apologize in advance for not caring.



Forked author:

I have added some expansions such as the retail pack and tabletop expansion, and modified some templates to conform
to the official released version. For example, the house of cards template now include the house of cards logo.

My version is available at http://gairne.co.uk/cah-gen/

Some notes:
I have had to replicate the retail pack and tabletop icons and have done so to be as authentic as possible.
The reject template is missing the designer's face as a logo.
